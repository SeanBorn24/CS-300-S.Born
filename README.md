**What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?**
In the projects within this course I was using array lists, hast tables, and bianry search trees to be able to develop a lsist to search through courses and thier prerequisites. 

**How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.**
I approached this by learning what wach of the data structures were and how they can be used. I took note of the pros and cons of each type to use in my final project. 

**How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?**
The biggest road block I came to is how to emplement these data structures into the code. I used youtube to help me learn how to set each type of data structure up. 

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
It has opened my eyes on new ways to complie data from large lists. I can use these in futer programs when I have a large amount of infromation that needs to be sorted through.
